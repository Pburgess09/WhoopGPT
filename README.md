WHOOP API Connector for ChatGPT

This README provides general instructions on how to build an API connector that integrates WHOOP biometric data with OpenAI's ChatGPT platform. The goal is to enable ChatGPT to access and interpret WHOOP user data for fitness insights, training recommendations, and wellness monitoring.

Overview

This connector allows ChatGPT to:

Retrieve WHOOP data via API (workouts, sleep, recovery, strain)

Analyze physiological metrics (HRV, RHR, sleep stages, etc.)

Provide personalized fitness feedback in a conversational format

Requirements

WHOOP Developer Account: Apply for access to WHOOP's API here (https://developer.whoop.com/)

OAuth 2.0 Integration: For secure authentication and access to user data

OpenAI GPT Platform: A custom GPT with plugin support

Steps to Build the Connector

1. Register Your WHOOP API Client

Go to the WHOOP Developer Portal

Create a new application and note the client ID and secret

Define your redirect URI for OAuth flow

2. Implement OAuth 2.0 Flow

Direct users to WHOOP's OAuth URL to authorize data access

Exchange the authorization code for an access token

Store and securely manage the access token for API calls

3. Connect WHOOP API to ChatGPT

Use OpenAI's plugin architecture to define the WHOOP API schema

Configure endpoints such as:

/workouts

/recovery

/sleep

/cycles

Enable the plugin within a custom GPT instance

4. Design Prompt and Logic in GPT

Program the GPT to interpret JSON responses from WHOOP

Apply logic for analyzing trends, e.g., recovery vs. strain

Format responses into actionable advice using natural language

5. Testing and Deployment

Test the connector with mock and real WHOOP data

Ensure proper handling of token expiration and error cases

Deploy the GPT for user interaction

Best Practices

Respect WHOOP data privacy policies

Use secure token storage

Provide users transparency on what data is accessed
